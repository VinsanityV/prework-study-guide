# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The included project is a study guide of some of the main points of the pre work for our Full-Stack web development course.

- Knowing that i successfully completed all the setup and the components of the prework study guide with no additional support, I am more than confident that i can become a successful programmer
- I built this project to reference back when i feel discouraged so i can remember where i came from and how much i ahve learned.
- The structures and definitions of web building is a complicated but rewarding practice. The utilization of html framework and CSS styling really allow the content to be shaped to the developers intent and js allows usability and interaction. I look forward to continuing my journey and buliding more complex projects!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
